        My first contact with programming was quite early - when I was 5 or 6, a
        single computer appeared in our kindergarten class, which was unheard of
        at the time. I don&apos;t remember much, but I know we were taking turns
        in front of it, &quot;playing&quot; <em>Balt√≠k / Baltie</em> - a
        programming language and IDE designed for kids - quite similar to{" "}
        <em>Scratch</em>, which seems to be popular nowadays.

        , it featured a list of tiles with various commands you could
        drag-and-drop to compose sequences (i.e. programs) and then watch a
        little wizard executing them. There were many concepts I couldn&apos;t
        wrap my head around at that age (such as drawers representing variables,
        or robots/helpers representing functions), but I still had tons of fun
        with it (both in kindergarten and at home) - building houses, drawing
        shapes, embedding MIDI audio, etc.
