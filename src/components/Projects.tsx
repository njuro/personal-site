        Here is a collection of my hobby & side programming projects that formed
        me as a programmer. Each project contains year(s) I was working on it,
        technology I used and lessons learned [1].
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not an exhaustive collection, as I omitted projects done in
        university, interview assignments for various companies and some other
        projects I haven&apos;t recalled much.

      <p style={{ fontSize: "14px", color: "grey" }}>
        [1] Also a story on how and why I started it, which probably is of a
        little interest for anyone but me, but it was a nice trip down the
        memory line writing it.
