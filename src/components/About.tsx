      <p>
        A 23 years old guy who likes to command computers, in order to make life
        easier for him, or others. I was born & raised in{" "}
        <em>Bratislava, Slovakia</em> and currently reside in{" "}
        <em>Brno, Czech Republic</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been attracted to computers almost all my life. My journey as
        a programmer began before I even realized it. Then, at age of 10, my dad
        brought me a book from his job about{" "}

          content="Yes, I know these aren't programming languages, shhh"
          trigger="HTML and CSS"
        />{" "}
        (released before I was born) and the never-ending learning process has
        officially started.
      </p>
      <Header as="h2">What can you do?</Header>
      <p>
        Right now, I am most comfortable building backends for web applications
        with <em>Java</em> and <em>Kotlin</em> (and the great{" "}
        <em>Spring Framework</em>). But during my not-so-long life, I have been
        exposed to many more languages and concepts such as{" "}
        <em>
          Python, JavaScript/TypeScript (React), Bash, SQL, C, C++, C#, Haskell,
          Prolog,
        </em>{" "}
        etc. I do not believe there is <em>One Right Way&trade;</em> to do
        everything, so I am always happy to expand my horizons and build my{" "}

        />{" "}
        further.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also familiar with the various tools software developers use in
        their everyday lives, such as <em>git, Docker, CI/CD pipelines</em> and
        so on - check out my{" "}

        I have been paid to make applications for others for some time now, but

        for that part.

        I also made an effort to document my hobby/side projects on this

        Conspiracy theory?
      </Header>
      <p>
        All pigeons are secretly government-issued spy drones and the pandemic
        happened so they could change the batteries without us noticing.

        Do you have a life besides sitting in front of a computer?
      </Header>
      <p>
        I like to think so. I discovered that if I go longer without significant
        physical activity my mental state deteriorates, I am less motivated and
        focused and my productivity as a programmer is also significantly lower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore I lift weights 3-6 times a week. I love going to the gym
        because it is very flexible - there is a gym in every city, I donâ€™t have
        to rely on anyone and I can choose whatever time suits me best. My other
        lifelong sport is volleyball (both in the gyms and on the sand) - I used
        to play in the club when I was 10-17 and since then I play
        semi-regularly with various groups. I think it is a great sport because
        it forces you to communicate, cooperate with your team and own your
        mistakes, which are all important soft skills even for a software
        engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other spare-time activities include avid book reading (although I
        have yet to recover the attention span I had as an early teenager),
        going to the pub with friends, or attending a rave/rap concert/festival.
